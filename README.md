Using the YOLOv5 network for image processing with detection and classification in real time using a custom database with classes created with the LabelImg tool.

For this development, I created a database using photos from some friends, my beloved wife and mine. Feel comfortable to create your own database of images and classes... have fun! ğŸ”¥ ğŸš€ ğŸ”¥
